    <textOnly>Hey {!Opportunity.SAPrimaryContact__c},



I have been trying to get in touch with you in regard to running your deal on [Affiliate name, website] &amp; DealChicken.com. This will be my last attempt to contact you.  We are working hard to feature the best [type of business] that [city] has to offer. Thereâ€™s still time to put together an offer for {company name}, but I need you to respond.



If you change your mind are interested in promoting a deal, please feel free to give me a call back



Best,

{!Opportunity.OwnerFullName}
