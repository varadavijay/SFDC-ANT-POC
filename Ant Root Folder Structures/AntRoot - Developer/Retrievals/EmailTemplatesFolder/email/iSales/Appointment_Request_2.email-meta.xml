    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.FirstName},

I hope you are well. I have been trying to get a hold of you. [Affiliate name] is looking for select local businesses to feature offers on DealChicken.com. We’d like to showcase {!Lead.Company}. With No upfront cost, DealChicken is a low-risk way for your business to be seen by [Affiliate name]’s audience.

Do you have time to speak later today or tomorrow?




Best,

{!Lead.OwnerFullName}
