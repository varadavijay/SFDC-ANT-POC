If you are running a promotion with another daily deal site, please let me know. We want to make sure that both deals can perform their best.

How will I know who purchases my deal?
After your deal starts, you&apos;ll receive a full report with the number of deals sold, a checklist of buyers and 		total revenue.

When will I receive payment?
Expect your first payment70% of your share of the deal&apos;s revenuefive business days after the deal ends if you&apos;ve chosen direct-deposit. If you&apos;ve chosen to receive a check, this process can take up to three weeks. The balance payment (excluding refunds, if any) will be processed 25 business days after your deal closes.
