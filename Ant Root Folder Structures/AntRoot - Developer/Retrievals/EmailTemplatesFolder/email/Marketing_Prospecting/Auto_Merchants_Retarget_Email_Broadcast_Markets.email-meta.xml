    <textOnly>Congratulations on your successful DealChicken promotion. You performed so well we&apos;d like you give you an exclusive opportunity to be featured again on our site.

As a reminder, your promotion will include:

Your offer featured on the DealChicken homepage and in the mobile app
Your offer on the broadcast station, the area&apos;s trusted news source

The great news is, we&apos;ll keep bringing new customers through your doors. So whether you&apos;re introducing new services, or simply want to stay top-of-mind, DealChicken will continue to fill your shop.

I will call you this week to set up a time to schedule your next promotion or feel free to contact me at {!Contact.OwnerFirstName} {!Contact.OwnerLastName} {!Contact.OwnerEmail} or {!Contact.OwnerPhone}.
