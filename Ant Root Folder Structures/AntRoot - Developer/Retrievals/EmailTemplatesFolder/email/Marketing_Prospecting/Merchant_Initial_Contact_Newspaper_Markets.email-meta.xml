I’m reaching out because our customers have shown interest in local businesses like yours.



As an affiliate of {!User.newspaper_broadcast_affiliate__c}, DealChicken exposes your business to a highly engaged, quality audience and introduces new customers to your business.  Our integrated marketing package features your business to local consumers on our website, within our daily email and in your local newspaper. We connect consumers to the things they need and want, and encourage them to experience something new. Best of all, there are no out of pocket costs to your business.

I’d love 15 minutes of your time to share how a DealChicken promotion can deliver new customers.

I have time available on:


{!Lead.Appointment_Time_1__c} or


{!Lead.Appointment_Time_2__c}


Please contact me at {!Lead.OwnerEmail} or by phone at {!Lead.OwnerPhone} to let me know which time works best for you.

In the meantime, feel free to visit our merchant site for more information, or download our information sheet.


Sincerely,
