    <subject>Introducing DealChicken Restaurant Week</subject>
    <textOnly>Wrap up the backyard BBQs and invite customers to enjoy the last days of summer at your restaurant... during DealChicken Restaurant Week. Unlike a traditional restaurant week, you won&apos;t have a rush of customers during one week - their visits will be spaced out over the time your promotion is valid, typically 6 months.



Restaurant deals are very popular with DealChicken users - it&apos;s our #1 category!  A promotional offer is a great way to introduce new customers to your restaurant.  For more information, download our Restaurant Week  information sheet.

To reserve one of eight featured Restaurant Week positions, contact {!Contact.OwnerFirstName} {!Contact.OwnerLastName} by August 16th at {!Contact.OwnerEmail} or {!Contact.OwnerPhone}.




DealChicken alerts consumers to great dining deals.
Consumers purchase the deal on DealChicken.com and redeem at your restaurant.
Merchants receive a revenue split less a 2.5% credit card processing fee.
