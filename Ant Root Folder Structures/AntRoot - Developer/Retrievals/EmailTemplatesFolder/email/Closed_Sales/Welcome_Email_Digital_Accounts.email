Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Welcome to G/O Digital! I am your new Digital Account Manager, and I will be helping you with your online marketing campaign. If you have any questions – from how something works to how to update your campaigns for slow season – I'm here to help.

You can expect an email shortly from our customer care team, who will help you design your local marketing programs. They'll be asking about any relevant business information, discounts or events you'd like to promote, discuss your goals for acquiring new customers and confirm the zip codes you'd like to target so we make sure you reach the right people.

I'll be coordinating this whole process - so if you have any questions, give me a call or shoot an email. I'm here to make it simple!
