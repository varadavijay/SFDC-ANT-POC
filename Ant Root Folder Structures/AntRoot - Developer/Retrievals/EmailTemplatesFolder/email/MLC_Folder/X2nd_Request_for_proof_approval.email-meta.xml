    <textOnly>Hello,

Your deal is currently scheduled to run on {!Opportunity.DC_Run_Date__c} and your promotion is ready to proof. Please click on the link below for a preview of your offer. Respond with your approval by today. Double check that the deal details match what we have in the contract, including all mentions of price and restrictions. As stated on the original proof approval email, we can only make revisions if the information is inaccurate or could be perceived as false advertising.


Hereâ€™s how it will appear on our site: {!Opportunity.DC_Proof_Hyperlink__c}



If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me at any time.



Thanks!</textOnly>
