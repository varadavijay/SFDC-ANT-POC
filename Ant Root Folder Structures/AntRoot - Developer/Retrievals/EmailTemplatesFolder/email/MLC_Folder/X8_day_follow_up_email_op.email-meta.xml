    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.SAPrimaryContact__c},



Time sure does fly when you’re a DealChicken merchant! Congratulations on {!Opportunity.Account}&apos;s successful completion of week one! We do hope your deal has been running smoothly and that the call today answered any  remaining questions.


As previously discussed, your initial payments will be based on the number of deals sold within the first 7 days. Our finance department processes your first payment in another five days.


Here’s how it works:


Initial payments are based on sales of your promotion during its first 7 days on our site (referred to as the &quot;initial&quot; period). You will receive 70% of the payment for your week one sales in a single check, roughly 12 days after your promotion starts running. You will receive the remaining 30% approximately 25 business days after your first payment.


For promotions running longer than 7 days, you will receive a monthly payment on or about the 15th of the following calendar month, less a 10% holdback. The holdback will be paid (excluding any refunds) as part of your next month&apos;s payment, until there is no longer a balance.



We appreciate your business and ask that you please take a moment to provide us feedback on your overall DealChicken experience. We look forward to hatching another deal together in the future.


Kind Regards,

The DealChicken Merchant Team</textOnly>
