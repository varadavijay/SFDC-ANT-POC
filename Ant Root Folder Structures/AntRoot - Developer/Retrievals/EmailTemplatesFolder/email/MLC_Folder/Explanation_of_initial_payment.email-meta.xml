    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for contacting us regarding your DealChicken payment. As a reminder, initial payments are based on sales of your promotion during its first 7 days on our site (referred to as the &quot;initial&quot; period). You will receive 70% of the payment for your week one sales in a single check, roughly 12 days after your promotion starts running. You will receive the remaining 30% approximately 25 business days after your first payment. 


Our records indicate that you sold a total of [# of certificates] in the first week, for deal proceeds of [total proceeds for first 7 days], of which [business name] receives a [split percentage] split for an initial payment of [initial payment amount before credit card fees] minus the 2.5% credit card fees [credit card fees total], for a payment of [initial check amount minus all fees].

Your next payment of [2nd payment] will consist of the remaining 30% of the initial payment (minus any refunds) which will be dispersed in approximately 25 business days.

Hope this helps clarify your initial payment. Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Kind Regards,</textOnly>
