    <textOnly>Hi

I have set you up with an account so you can pull the certificate report whenever you would like, as well as to view individual certificates, etc.

I sent a password reset request to __________  so you can create a new password.

To utilize this merchant feature, please follow these steps:

1.	Visit www.DealChicken.com
2.	In the top right-hand corner, click ‘Sign In’
3.	Place your cursor below ‘My Deals’ and a drop-down box will appear
4.	Select ‘Vendor’
5.	This will take you to the merchant portal where you can view deals, certificates, and pull reports

I have also attached a document that details this process.

The second document is our merchant redemption tool one-sheeter.  This details how you can redeem used vouchers, track new customers, and calculate various other statistics.

If you have any questions on this, feel free to reach out to me.</textOnly>
