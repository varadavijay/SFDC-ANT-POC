    <textOnly>Hi,

Thank you again for your interest in partnering with DealChicken.  At this time, we are ready to move forward with the pre-approval process.

Please provide us with 3 referrals, so we can contact them regarding past performance.  These referrals must be daily deal sites or E-commerce business partners.

We will need the following information for each business:

Business Name
Business website
Business point of contact
Business phone &amp; email

In order to expedite this process, you are welcome to reach out to these referrals to let them know that we will be contacting them.

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thank you very much.

The DealChicken team</textOnly>
