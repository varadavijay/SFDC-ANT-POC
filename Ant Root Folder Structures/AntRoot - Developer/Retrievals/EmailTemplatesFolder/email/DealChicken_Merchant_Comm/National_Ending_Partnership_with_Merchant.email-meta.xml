    <textOnly>Hi,

Thank you for your interest in DealChicken!

We’re pleased you took the time to share your business with our selection team.  At this time, however, we are unable to run additional promotions on our site.

DealChicken offers a unique product mix that varies based on market, current purchasing trends, merchant reputation and various other metrics.  Our decision is the result of a complex scoring system, and not the decision of an individual staff member.

Market conditions do change, so we’ll keep your contact information on file.  If anything changes, we will be sure to reach out to your team.

Thank you very much for your interest in DealChicken.

The DealChicken team</textOnly>
