    <textOnly>Hi,

Thank you for your interest in DealChicken!

We’re pleased you took the time to share your product with our selection team. At this time, however, we are unable to feature your products on our site.

DealChicken offers a unique product mix that varies based on market, current purchasing trends, merchant reputation and various other metrics. Our decision is the result of a complex scoring system, and not the decision of an individual staff member.

Market conditions do change, so we’ll keep your contact information on file. In the interim, please let us know if you make material changes to your product offerings, pricing, etc.

Thank you very much for your interest in DealChicken.

The DealChicken team</textOnly>
