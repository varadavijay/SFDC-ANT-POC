    <textOnly>Hi,

Thank you again for your interest in partnering with DealChicken.  Unfortunately, we have been unable to get in contact with any of the business referrals you provided to us.

We are very excited to develop a partnership, but will need a response from these referrals in order to move forward.

At your earliest convenience, can you reach out to your referrals to remind them that we have been attempting to contact them?

If you have additional business referrals, we can contact them as well.

Thank you very much.

The DealChicken team</textOnly>
