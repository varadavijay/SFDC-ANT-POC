Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, 

I hope you are well. I called for our scheduled appointment again, but you were not available. This will be my last time reaching out. It is a real shame because you are in a terrific position to see success like many of the other {INDUSTRY}'s that we work with. 

If you change your mind and decide you are interested in receiving new local customers, please feel free to reach back out to me. 

Best, 

{!Opportunity.OwnerFirstName}
