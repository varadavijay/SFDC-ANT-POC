    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

When it comes to HVAC marketing and advertising – it’s adapt to digital and mobile or continue to lose more customers to your competition.

After searching for {!Lead.Company} online, I wanted to reach out because I know I can help you get more phone calls and appointments - all within a budget you can afford.  What time of day is best for me to reach you?

Sincerely,

{!Lead.OwnerFullName}
