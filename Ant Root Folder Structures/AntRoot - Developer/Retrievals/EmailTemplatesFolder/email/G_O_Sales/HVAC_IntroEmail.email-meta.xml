    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

It&apos;s a fact: More than half of your prior-year customers can&apos;t remember your  name and 43% of them will turn to the Internet to find an HVAC business when their system fails.* Will they find you again - or your competitors?

Watch how Kay Heating and Air Conditioning keeps its customers coming back because of its website, search and social presence: Watch the Video

Do you want more customers too? Or are you OK with losing them to your competition?  Contact me today so we can discuss how to get you more calls!

Sincerely,

{!Lead.OwnerFullName}
