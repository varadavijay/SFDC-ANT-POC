    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

We spoke a while back about G/O Digital, the leader in digital marketing services for local businesses.

In today’s competitive digital landscape, it’s important to see how you measure up. Our digital assessment will identify which digital marketing services can help take your local business to the next level – and it’s completely free.  Get started by requesting your free audit here.

To ensure the assessment is perfectly tailored to your business, we will also need to schedule a quick 10-minute call. Please reply back to let me know what date and time is convenient for you and I’ll set one up!

Sincerely,

{!Lead.OwnerFullName}
