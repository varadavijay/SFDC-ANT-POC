    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

I hope this email finds you well!  I wanted to reach out to discuss how I can help your business get in front of more customers.

Do you know how many customers you are losing to your competitors? Give me a call and let&apos;s talk about how you can get ahead of your competition for prime advertising spots on Google, Yahoo!, Bing and Facebook!

Are you available for a quick call this week?

Cheers,
