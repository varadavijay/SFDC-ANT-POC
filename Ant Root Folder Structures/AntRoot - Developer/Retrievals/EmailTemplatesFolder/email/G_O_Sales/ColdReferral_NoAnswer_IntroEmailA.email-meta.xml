    <textOnly>Hey {!Lead.FirstName},

My name is {!Lead.OwnerFirstName} and I&apos;m with G/O Digital. We work with thousands of businesses like {!Lead.Company} with their digital marketing campaigns that target more local customers across Google, Facebook, mobile and more!

Could you direct me to the right person to talk to about this at {!Lead.Company} so we can explore whether or not G/O Digital can help get your business in front of more local customers?

Cheers,

{!Lead.OwnerFullName}
