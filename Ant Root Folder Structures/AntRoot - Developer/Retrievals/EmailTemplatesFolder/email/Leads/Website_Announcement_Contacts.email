Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, 

I just wanted to send a personal note to let you know that G/O Digital has officially launched a brand new website. Check it out at http://godigitalmarketing.com/local. There are tons of great educational resources to explore and lots of ideas for marketing {!Account.Name}, but I just wanted to highlight a few features that I think you will really appreciate:

*Our local marketing newsletter (called the GO Signposts) will be debuting at the beginning of August. Sign up now at http://www.gannettlocal.com/contact-us/newsletter to start receiving monthly tips designed for your industry. 
*Learn from other GannettLocal customers and get their advice for local marketing success: http://godigitalmarketing.com/local/case-studies. 
*Our innovative new tool, EasyStreet, lets you generate your own custom "roadmap" for local marketing. Just complete the easy wizard (starting at the yellow road sign on http://godigitalmarketing.com/local) to get your free results. Of course, if you want to discuss the results or get started with a local marketing campaign, just let me know. I'm here to help. 

Also, don't forget about our action-packed blog (http://blog.godigitalmarketing.com). We publish daily articles on everything from social media to running holiday promotions, and there are already over 20 posts to browse!

I hope you get a chance to visit our new website and take advantage of all these new resources. I'll be in touch soon to check in and see if you have any questions. 

Have a great day,
