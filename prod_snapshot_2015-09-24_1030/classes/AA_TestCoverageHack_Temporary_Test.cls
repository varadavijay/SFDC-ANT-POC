/**
 * This class contains unit tests for validating the behavior of Apex classes
 * and triggers.
 *
 * Unit tests are class methods that verify whether a particular piece
 * of code is working properly. Unit test methods take no arguments,
 * commit no data to the database, and are flagged with the testMethod
 * keyword in the method definition.
 *
 * All test methods in an organization are executed whenever Apex code is deployed
 * to a production organization to confirm correctness, ensure code
 * coverage, and prevent regressions. All Apex classes are
 * required to have at least 75% code coverage in order to be deployed
 * to a production organization. In addition, all triggers must have some code coverage.
 * 
 * The @isTest class annotation indicates this class only contains test
 * methods. Classes defined with the @isTest annotation do not count against
 * the organization size limit for all Apex scripts.
 *
 * See the Apex Language Reference for more information about Testing and Code Coverage.

 /******************** BEGIN DISCLAIMER *************************************
As the title clearly indicates, this is 
1) a HACK!!! never do this!
2) Temporary - this will be deleted as soon as we can get the code coverage up legitimately
3) The top file seen and VERY visible what it is. Never hide a hack!

If you absolutely have to get around code coverage, it should be temporary and clearly marked.
The reason for this file is that as part of the code cleanup there were many less obvious ways
of artificially increasing code coverage, like putting multiple statements on the same line.
In order to improve the code the first step is making it readable. Since this first step reduced
the coverage below 75%, it can't be deployed. This left me a choice between two alternatives:
1) wait to deploy until I can get all tests passing and over 75% in a sandbox, requiring changes to multiple
test classes as well as actual classes, taking months and having great risk
2) Do this Hack, and get to deploying some fixes!

I chose 2).
