    <textOnly>Hello [Merchant],

I have created an account which will allow you to pull the certificate report whenever you would like, as well as to view individual certificates, etc.

Login Details:
Username: 
Password: dealchicken

To utilize this merchant feature, please follow these steps:

1.	Visit www.DealChicken.com
2.	In the top right-hand corner, click ‘Sign In’ (Use sign in details above)
3.	Place your cursor below ‘My Deals’ and a drop-down box will appear
4.	Select ‘Vendor’
5.	This will take you to the merchant portal where you can view deals, certificates, and pull reports

Before logging off I encourage you to change your password. Following these steps:
1.           Place your cursor over the “Welcome, Your Account”,  located in the right-corner of the screen.
2.           Select “Your Account”
3.           Select “Change Password”

I have also attached a document that details this process.

The second document is our merchant redemption tool one-sheeter.  This details how you can redeem used vouchers, track new customers, and calculate various other statistics.

If you have any questions on this, feel free to reach out to us.

Kind Regards,</textOnly>
