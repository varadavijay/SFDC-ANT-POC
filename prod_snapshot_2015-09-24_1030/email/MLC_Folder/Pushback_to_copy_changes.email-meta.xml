    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.Name},

Thank you for providing your requested changes to the DealChicken proof. Unfortunately we will be unable to make the requested changes because it is outside of our proofing policy.

As stated on the proof approval email, we can only make revisions outside of the deal details if the information is inaccurate or could be perceived as false advertisement. Your request is outside of this policy and is considered a marketing change, which is our expertise.

Our professional writers craft a message in a manner to ensure your business is the star of our site and the proof in its original form does just that!  Please take another look at the proof and if all deal details (fine print and company details) are accurate, please provide your written approval.

You can preview the proof again by clicking here: {!Opportunity.DC_Proof_Hyperlink__c}

Thanks for your understanding in this matter.  

My best,</textOnly>
