    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.Name},

We understand you have some questions about what happens now that your deal is expired. While the promotional value has expired, the amount that the customer paid is valid for 5 or more years depending on which state you live in.

This is something that&apos;s regulated by the Federal Government. DealChicken is unable to provide you with legal advice pertaining to your business. You should consult your own attorney.


We can give you the following information:
